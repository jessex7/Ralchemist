Add the spinach, a pinch of salt and cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute. Set aside to cool completely. (I usually place this outside in the winter to cool fast). Spray a nonstick sheet pan with oil or line with a silicone mat. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 16 x 10 inch rectangle. Place the veggies over the dough leaving about 1 1/2 inch from the edge. Top with cheese. Use the egg wash and brush along the edge of the dough. Fold one side of the dough over to cover the filling, then the short edges, followed by the other side, stretching slightly to seal, pinching the ends so nothing oozes out. Lay the bread seam side down on the prepared pan. Cut small slats in the top and brush with egg white. Top with sesame seeds, if using. Bake 25 to 35 minutes, until golden brown on top and the dough is cooked on the end. Remove from the oven and let it cool 5 minutes before slicing into 8 pieces. Serve with marinara sauce on the side."

Then flip over, and continue cooking about 25 minutes, or until the juices run clear and no longer pink when the thigh is pierced with a pairing knife near the joint, and the internal temperature is 165\u00b0F. For a larger bird, this will take more time. (Insert thermometer between the thickest part of the leg and the thigh) When the chicken\u2019s done, remove it to a platter and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving. Save carved carcass for stock if desired. Serve the chicken, skin is optional. To bake in the oven, bake 400F until golden and crisp and brown all over and the juices run clear when you insert a knife down to the bone between the leg and the thigh, or the internal temperature is 165\u00b0F, about 1 hour or longer as needed."

Optional: tightly tie together the legs of the chicken with a piece of butcher\u2019s twine. Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl (large enough to hold the chicken) and pour in the buttermilk. Cover tight and refrigerate overnight rotating the chicken half way so both sides gets marinated. Remove the chicken from the fridge an hour before you plan to cook it, then remove the chicken from the buttermilk shaking excess and discarding the buttermilk. When ready to cook, transfer the chicken to the air fryer basket (at least 6 quart) belly side down. Season the top of the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Air fry 350F about 25 minutes, until the top of the chicken is browned, then flip over, season the other side with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook 25 minutes, until golden and crisp and brown all over and the juices run clear when you insert a knife down to the bone between the leg and the thigh. When the chicken\u2019s done, remove it to a platter and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving. To bake in the oven, bake 400F until golden and crisp and brown all over and the juices run clear when you insert a knife down to the bone between the leg and the thigh, about 1 hour or longer if needed."

Taste 4 cups water and taste for salt, it should be flavorful and salty enough, adjust as needed. Let the water boil on a high heat stirring once at this point. As the water boils down and just barely skims the top of the rice, reduce heat to very low and cover 15 minutes. The steam will cook the rice so do not open the lid. After 15 minutes, shut the flame off and let it sit at least 5 more minutes without touching the lid. The steam will finish cooking the rice without burning the bottom. Then fluff with a fork and enjoy."

If it\u2019s too sticky, add a few extra sprinkles of flour. Divide in 4 equal balls. Working with 1 ball at a time, lightly dust a rolling pin and a work surface and roll dough into a 5 \u00bd\u201d circle, about \u00bc\u201d thick. Spread 2 teaspoons pizza sauce down the middle of the circle, leaving about 1/2\u201d border. Lay 1 slice of cheese in the middle of the circle then top with 1/2 sausage link. Carefully bring both sides of the dough up, wrap one side around the sausage then the other. Press dough together so it\u2019s sealed around the sausage and place it on the prepared sheet pan seam side-down. Repeat with remaining dough, sauce, cheese and sausage. Brush each with egg wash, top with sesame seeds, if using, and bake for 25-30 minutes.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes then slice into 6 pieces and serve."

Once all the shrimp is breaded, if you still have crumbs left, re-dip the shrimp back into the egg beaters and then back into crumbs and back onto the baking sheet. Spray the top of the shrimp generously with oil then bake in the middle rack for about 6-7 minutes. Turn shrimp over then cook another 3 minutes or until cooked though. Remove from oven and serve right away with lemon wedges, if desired."

Once it cools, cube it and set aside. It\u2019s fine to leave it out overnight if making ahead. This makes 9 cups. Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Spray\u00a0a 9 x 12 inch baking dish with oil. Place cubed cornbread on a large sheet pan. Bake, gently stirring twice, until lightly toasted and firm, about 35 minutes. Cool completely; transfer to a large bowl. Increase oven to 350F. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking it up until browned. Add onion, celery and parsley; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 12 minutes. Add thyme, sage, salt and pepper; continue to cook for 5 minutes. Add onion mixture to bowl with beaten eggs and cornbread. Drizzle broth over stuffing mixture; gently toss until evenly moistened. Spoon stuffing into prepared baking dish and bake 350F uncovered for 40 to 45 minutes."

Prick the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork. Place crust on a small sheet pan (this makes is much easier to transfer to the oven once it\u2019s filled). Transfer the pie crust to your pre-heated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until par-baked. Then remove. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 30 seconds.\u00a0 Add the zucchini, \u00bd teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste and toss to evenly combine. Cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring every couple minutes, until the zucchini has softened and flavors combined. With a slotted spoon, transfer three-quarters of the zucchini to par-baked crust. In a medium bowl, add the eggs, milk, ricotta, mozzarella, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, basil and \u00bd teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste. Using a fork, mix to combine until uniform. Pour egg mixture into the crust over the zucchini. Top with remaining zucchini and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Cover the crust with aluminum foil so it doesn\u2019t burn and place in oven quiche in oven. Bake 350F 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until set and top is browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Top with basil, slice into 6 pieces and serve."

Set aside 2 tablespoons then place salmon in a shallow bowl or Tupperware container and add the rest of the marinade. Refrigerate and allow to marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. (If you don't have time, you can let it marinade 20 minutes) In a medium bowl, add the mayonnaise, gochujang and 1 tablespoon water. Whisk to combine.\u00a0 Add the coleslaw and scallions and toss to combine. Heat a clean outdoor grill (make sure the grates are clean and lightly oiled) or if cooking indoors an oiled grill pan over medium-high heat. Place salmon pieces, flesh side down, on the grill and cook 3-5 minutes (thinner fillets will cook quicker than a thicker piece), or until salmon easily releases from the grill and is nicely charred. Carefully flip with a spatula, top each piece with a tablespoon of reserved marinade and cook an additional 2-4 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Set aside on a clean cutting board or plate. Meanwhile, heat the tortillas over an open flame, on the grill or microwave. Place 2 tortillas each on 4 plates. Using a spatula, break up the fish into pieces, sliding the spatula between the flesh and skin to remove the skin. Place a piece or 2 of salmon on each tortilla then top each with 1/3 cup slaw.\u00a0 Repeat with remaining fish and slaw.\u00a0 Serve immediately."

Remove the sausage from the casing, add to the skillet and cook over medium heat, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until just cooked through (don\u2019t overcook or it will become rubbery). Remove sausage from skillet and place in a serving bowl, cover and set aside while you cook the mushrooms. Add 1 teaspoon butter to the skillet. \u00a0When melted, add the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and pepper, to taste. Saut\u00e9 mushrooms for 4 minutes. Add the sausage back to the skillet, stir to combine and cook 30 seconds. Transfer cooked oats to a bowl, add remaining half teaspoon butter, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon Parmesan and stir. Top with mushroom and sausage mixture. Cook the egg runny, or to your likie and top the bowl.  Add the remaining tablespoon Parmesan cheese and chives, if using."

Set aside on a dish to cool, then flake the salmon into a large bowl. Add the olive oil to the pan, then add the the onion, celery, red and yellow bell peppers, parsley, capers, hot sauce, Old Bay seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large saute pan over medium-low heat and cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately 18 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature. To the large bowl with the salmon add the breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard, cooled vegetable mixture, and eggs. Mix well. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or freeze 10 minutes. This will make them easier to shape and become less sticky. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Spray a non-stick baking sheet with cooking spray. Shape the salmon into 15 (scant 1/4 cup each) cakes and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake the salmon cakes for 20 minutes, or until they are golden and cooked through."

In a separate bowl, mix together the oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pecans, the coconut, dates or raisins, if using, and chia seeds. Add to the mashed banana and mix to combine. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and even it out with a spatula. Sprinkle with cinnamon and place the pan on a trivet or rack. Cover with foil and then lower the trivet into the Instant Pot. Lock the lid into place, set the Pressure Release Knob to Sealing, cook at high pressure 35 minutes. Once the cooking cycle is done, let the pressure release naturally. Using silicone mini mitts, carefully remove the trivet with the pan and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Use a knife to loosen the sides and slice into 4 pieces. Top with the remaining chopped pecans and cinnamon, and serve. The bars can be stored, refrigerated in a closed container, for up to 5 days."

Simmer, covered on low about 5 minutes, until it thickens and the flavors meld. When the potatoes are ready, cut them open and top each with a scant cup of the turkey mixture. Eat hot."

Gradually whisk in the chicken broth, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the milk and increase heat to high until it comes to a boil, then add broccoli florets, Parmesan cheese, and stir well. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered over low heat until broccoli is cooked, about 10 minutes. Using an immersion blender quickly blend part of the soup for a quick second or two. If you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, remove about 1-2 cups of soup and blend, then add it back to the soup. This helps thicken it a bit. Gently stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, allowing it to melt smoothly. Serve the soup hot, garnished with additional cheddar cheese, if desired."

Form small meatballs, about the size of a ping ping ball (1/8th cup each). If you wish, you can brown the meatballs in a skillet, or brown them in the broiler on a sheet pan until the tops are golden, 7 to 8 minutes. OR you can gently plop them right into the sauce. Add the meatballs to the sauce and cook about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and onion and serve over pasta or whole wheat Italian bread."

Add \u00bc cup lemon juice and mix to incorporate. While you whisk the eggs, gradually drizzle in 1 ladleful (about 1 cup) of the broth (it\u2019s OK if some grains of rice tag along) and mix until fully combined. Pour the lemon-egg mixture into the pot with the broth, immediately remove from the heat, and stir in the shredded chicken. Taste and add more lemon juice to taste.

Add the garlic, chili powder, and oregano and cook, stirring often until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and the stock, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes. While the soup is simmering, brush each tortilla with the oil, then stack on a cutting board. Cut the tortilla stack in half, then into 1/2-inch wide strips.  Arrange the strips on a sheet pan in a single layer (you may need to use more than one pan, or bake in rounds.) Season the strips with a few pinches of salt and bake until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken or turkey meat to the soup pot and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for another 5 minutes to heat the turkey meat. To serve, top the soup with a handful of tortilla strips and cilantro, plus optional avocado, sour cream and cheese."

Add 1 bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic, the small onion and bay leaves to the beans. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender, stirring occasionally. (Add water if necessary) Discard the veggies. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat oil on medium-low. Add chopped vegetables (onion, parsley, carrots, pepper, garlic) season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper, to taste and saut\u00e9 for about 5 to 6 minutes, or until soft. Add the vegetables to the soup after it has simmered an hour, then add wine, vinegar, cumin, oregano, bouillon, and adjust water if needed. Cover and simmer on low about 30 minutes, stirring. Remove bay leaves, then using an immersion blender, partially blend the soup for about 10 seconds to thicken. If you don't have an immersion blender, put about 3 cups of the soup in a blender, then add it back to the pot. Adjust 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and cumin to taste and ladle about 1 1/4 cups into each bowl. Top with sour cream if desired, chopped onions, scallions, chives or/or cilantro and enjoy!"

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to deglaze. Set aside and wipe out the skillet. If the chicken is not uniformly thin, place it between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a heavy pan until thin but still intact. Season to taste with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper and set aside. In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, pinch of salt, and paprika. Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and melt 1 teaspoon butter.  Dredge two of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, then shake off the excess and lay them side by side in the pan.\u00a0 Cook the chicken for 3 minutes, or until lightly browned, then flip and cook for 3 more minutes. Set aside on a dish and repeat with the remaining butter and chicken. Set aside. Combine the broth and 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture and mix, add it to the skillet and whisk on low heat, 1 minute, until it thickens. Toss the rest of the flour out. Return the chicken to the skillet, top with onions and cheese and cover. Cook low 3 to 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling. "

Cook until browned and cooked through in the center, about 5 minutes, flipping so it cooks on each side. Set aside in a medium bowl and toss with the hot sauce. Pour 3/4 cup rice in each bowl, top each with 1/4 cup beans and cheese, divide the chicken over the bowls. If eating right away, I like to melt the cheese by putting it in the microwave 30 seconds.

Add the chicken to the remaining marinade and let sit for at least 15 minutes up to 4 hours. Heat a large, heavy cast-iron or stainless steel skillet with a lid over high heat. Pour 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil into the pan and swirl to coat. Use a slotted spoon to add half the chicken to the skillet, and stir and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon. Cook chicken for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. (Cover briefly, as needed, to prevent splatters.) Transfer to a plate and set aside.  If your skillet has caked-on starch or burned garlic, return it to the heat and add a cupful of water to help scrape it off. Discard into the sink and wipe the skillet dry with paper towels. Heat another 1 teaspoon of oil. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Clean the skillet once more and pour in the remaining teaspoon of oil. Once hot, stir in the onions and saut\u00e9 them until they are lightly charred but still retain some crunch, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken back in. Pour in the remaining marinade and add 1/2 cup water. Cook for another minute, then stir in the bok choy until wilted. Transfer to a platter and top with the crushed peanuts and basil. Serve over rice, or cauliflower rice, if desired. Makes 8 cups."

Toss the onions and sweet potatoes in oil and salt and spread out on the prepared baking sheet. Roast for about 50 min, until the vegetables are cooked but not burnt. You don\u2019t want any black bits. You are going to put them into the pot to boil and cook further. Transfer the vegetables to a large saucepan and add the vegetable broth, ginger, turmeric, and cayenne. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer, partially covered, for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the macadamias. Allow the mixture to stand for 10 minutes to soften the nuts and cool the soup slightly. Pour the soup into your blender in batches and puree on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until smooth and creamy. (For conventional blenders, remove the small center lid cap and cover the opening with a kitchen towel so steam can escape while you blend.) Return the soup to the saucepan, season to taste, and warm it over low heat. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and add a splash of the lime juice, top with cilantro and macadamias if using."

Transfer both sheet pans to the oven and cook for 35 minutes, tossing halfway through and rotating pans to allow for even browning. Meanwhile, warm the tortillas (over an open flame, in a pan or in the microwave).\u00a0 I prefer heating mine over an open flame, covering as them as I go to keep them warm.

Meanwhile, line a muffin tin with 12 muffin nonstick liners and spray with oil. Mix almond flour, oat flour, baking powder and baking soda with a whisk in a medium bowl. In a large bowl with a hand mixer, mix and cream the butter and sugar on medium setting for about 2 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites and vanilla with a whisk, add to bowl with butter/sugar mixture. Mix in the yogurt, then flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined, 1 minute. With a spatula, fold in the strawberries and spoon to lined muffin tins about 3/4 filled (I used an ice cream scoop). Bake at 375F or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool before eating."

Season scallops with salt and pepper. Heat a large pan on a high heat. When the pan is hot, add oil and place scallops in the pan. Sear without touching them for a few minutes until the bottom forms a nice caramel colored crust. Turn and cook about another minute while their centers are still slightly translucent (you can check this by viewing them from the side). Be careful not to overcook. Remove from the pan. Divide the baby greens evenly between four plates. Arrange grapefruit on the plate and top with scallops; drizzle with vinaigrette."

Heat a 10-inch skillet on low heat; melt half of the butter and add the onions with a pinch of salt and pepper. Slowly cook the onions, stirring occasionally until the onions become translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Bring the heat up to medium and cook until the onions caramelize. Set the onions aside. Increase the heat to medium-high, add remaining butter and add the chard stems. Cook about 3-4 minutes. Add the chard leaves to the pan and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low; pour egg mixture into the skillet and add caramelized onions, salt and pepper and mix well to blend. Reduce heat to low and cook until the edges set, about 6-8 minutes. Once the bottom and edges set, place in the oven and bake until completely set through, about 4-5 minutes. Remove from the oven and place a dish over the pan; flip onto the plate. Cut into wedges and serve."

Roast for about 40 min, until the vegetables are cooked but not burnt. Meanwhile, place the cashews in a small bowl and top with 3/4 of the hot broth. Allow the mixture to stand 10 minutes to soften the nuts. When the vegetables are done, peel the squash and transfer the vegetables to the pot and add the ginger, turmeric, and cayenne. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium and simmer, partially covered, for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the cashews. Pour the soup into your blender in batches and puree on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until smooth and creamy. (For conventional blenders, remove the small center lid cap and cover the opening with a kitchen towel so steam can escape while you blend.) Return the soup to the saucepan, season to taste, and eat warm. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, top with cilantro and chopped cashews if using."

Place 1/4 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of a large (or 2 small) baking dish, and place zucchini halves cut side up. Using a spoon, fill each hollowed zucchini with 1/3 cup chicken mixture, pressing firmly. Top each with 2 tablespoons of enchilada sauce, and 1 1/2 tablespoons each of shredded cheese. Cover with foil and bake 35 minutes until cheese is melted and zucchini is tender. Top with scallions and cilantro for garnish and serve with Greek yogurt or sour cream, if desired."

Season the turkey all over with 1\u00bd teaspoons of the salt and the black pepper, then rub all over with the garlic. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise and za\u2019atar. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the za\u2019atar mayo to a separate small bowl and brush that all over the turkey. Set the remaining za\u2019atar mayo aside. Let the turkey sit at room temperature for 15 minutes while you prepare everything else. In a large bowl, toss together sweet potatoes, 1 tablespoon of the oil, the maple syrup, \u00bc teaspoon of the salt, and the red pepper flakes. Place turkey on a rimmed sheet pan and arrange the potatoes in a single layer around it. Roast for 20 minutes. In the same bowl (no need to wash it), toss the brussels sprouts with 2 tablespoons of the oil, the cumin seeds, and the remaining \u00bc teaspoon salt. Give the potatoes a toss after roasting for 20 minutes, and push the wedges to one side of the pan to make room for the brussels sprouts. Add the sprouts and continue to roast until the sprouts and potatoes are golden brown and a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey registers 145\u00baF, 20 to 30 minutes longer (for a total turkey roasting time of 40 to 50 minutes). Allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Discard turkey skin (to reduce calories, if desired as the nutritional info reflects no skin) and carve. While the turkey is resting, season reserved za\u2019atar mayo to taste and add a little more oil and salt, if needed. Season to taste with lemon juice. Serve the za\u2019atar mayo alongside the turkey and vegetables."

Place flour and \u00bc teaspoon salt on a large plate. Place egg in a bowl, add 1 teaspoon water and beat until uniform. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and cayenne (if using) and black pepper, to taste, to the toasted panko and place the plate on the other side of the egg bowl. Working with about 15 pieces at a time, dredge in flour, lightly coating all sides. Then, egg, allowing excess to drip off (I like to use tongs and wipe the excess off on the side of the bowl).\u00a0 Next add the pieces to the panko mixture and coat all sides evenly, pressing crumbs to make sure they adhere evenly. Repeat with remaining pieces. Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F. Spray the basket with olive oil. Add about 30 pieces to the air fryer basket, making sure to leave space between each piece so they get crispy. Spray the top with oil. Cook for 5 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cook time.\u00a0 Serve immediately."

Set the rest aside for another use. Heat a cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add the onions and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Lower the heat to medium-low heat, and cook, stirring often until caramelized, about 30 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. In a medium mixing bowl, toss the sliced butternut with the remaining olive oil, another 1/4 teaspoon of salt, half of the Parmesan cheese, half of the thyme and a few cracks of black pepper. Roll the pastry out on a parchment paper lined sheet pan and prick the pastry with a fork in several places, avoiding the outer 1 1/2-inch border. Spread 1/3 of the caramelized onions on the bottom of the crust, again avoiding the outer border. Arrange the sliced butternut on top of the onions in several concentric layers, nestling the remaining half of the onions between the layers of butternut squash. Sprinkle the top with the remaining Parmesan and thyme leaves. Fold the edges of the pastry up onto the butternut squash, making pleats as you move around the circle. Brush the edges of the brush with the egg. Tent with foil, tightly over the baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake until the pastry is golden-brown and the butternut is tender, about 20 to 30 minutes more. (check the center of the squash with a toothpick to make sure it's tender) Slice into 6 pieces and serve warm."

In a small lidded saucepan, combine the rice, cooking liquid and salt and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 35-40 minutes, until tender. Drain any excess liquid and set aside.\u00a0 Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Crumble the sausage into a skillet and cook until lightly browned, but still pink in some areas. Add the mushrooms, garlic and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring until the mushrooms are soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in the kale, and cook until completely wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the cranberries and 1 tablespoon of the chopped thyme and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat. Toss with the prepared rice. Once the squash is done, set it aside until cool enough to safely handle. Cupping the sides of the squash with one hand so that it doesn\u2019t tear, spoon out some of the flesh, leaving a 3/4\u201d border around the sides and bottom.  Dice the remaining squash in small pieces and mix with the rice and sausage. Divide the sausage mixture between the hollowed out squash halves and fill to the top, mounding in the middle if there is extra. Return to the oven to cook for another 5 minutes. Arrange on a platter and serve immediately."
